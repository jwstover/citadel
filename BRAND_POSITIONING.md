## Frameworks Overview

### 1. April Dunford's "Obviously Awesome" Method

The most widely recommended framework for SaaS positioning. Focuses on 5 core components in sequential order:

| Component | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Competitive Alternatives** | What would customers do if your solution didn't exist? |
| **Unique Attributes** | What features/capabilities differentiate you from alternatives? |
| **Value** | What practical benefits do those capabilities enable? |
| **Target Customers** | Who cares most about your unique value? |
| **Market Category** | What context makes your value obvious to target customers? |

**Key insight:** Start with competitive alternatives, as everything downstream depends on getting this right. Competitors often aren't direct competitors—they might be "do nothing," spreadsheets, or manual processes.

### 2. Kalungi's Pains-Claims-Gains Model

Focuses on three critical positioning questions:

- **Why change?** (from current solution)
- **Why you?** (vs alternatives)
- **Why now?** (urgency)

Structure:
1. Setting the Stage - industry context
2. Pains - persona pain points and fears
3. Gains + Claims - aspirations and benefits

### 3. Heavybit's Bottom-Up Framework

Build messaging hierarchically:
1. Brand Pillars (3 thematic "idea buckets")
2. Headline Benefits (25 words max each)
3. Elevator Pitch (55 words max)
4. Positioning Statement (25 words max)
5. Brand Promise/Tagline (10 words max)
6. Mission Statement

### 4. Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) Framework

Focus on the "job" customers are hiring your product to do:
- What progress is the customer trying to make?
- What circumstances trigger them to seek a solution?
- What outcomes define success?

## Key Questions to Answer

### About Our Product

- [x] What is Citadel in one sentence?
  > Citadel is a project management application that helps small teams build faster and stay on track with assistance of AI.
- [x] What problem does Citadel solve?
  > **The "right-size" problem:** Existing tools are either too complex (Jira - bloated with features small teams don't need) or too unstructured (spreadsheets, docs - no real project management). Citadel provides the right set of features for solo devs and small teams without the overhead.
- [ ] What would our customers do if Citadel didn't exist?
- [x] What are our 3-5 key differentiating features?
  1. **AI-powered planning** - Break down complex features into actionable tasks; AI understands your project context and helps at all stages of planning
  2. **AI-assisted task creation** - Create tasks from plain text descriptions
  3. **MCP tools integration** - Integrates directly into AI tools developers already use (Claude, etc.)
  4. **AI-generated insights** - Summaries, retrospectives, progress reports
  5. **AI-assisted prioritization & scheduling** - Smart suggestions for what to work on next
- [x] What value do those features enable?
  > **Core theme: "Spend time building, not managing."**
  >
  > | Feature | Value |
  > |---------|-------|
  > | AI-powered planning | Turn a big idea into an actionable plan in seconds |
  > | AI task creation | Capture ideas instantly without breaking flow |
  > | MCP integration | Manage projects without leaving your coding environment |
  > | AI summaries/retros | Skip the status update grind - instant clarity on progress |
  > | AI prioritization | Stop wondering "what next?" - always know the highest-impact task |
- [x] What category do we belong to?
  > **AI-native project management** - Not project management with AI bolted on, but project management designed to fit seamlessly into AI-powered workflows. Works where people already use AI (coding assistants, chat interfaces) and streamlines their existing workflow.

## Exercises to Complete

### Exercise 1: Competitive Alternatives Mapping

List everything customers might do instead of using Citadel:

| Alternative | Type | Pros for Customer | Cons for Customer |
|------------|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Do nothing / ad-hoc | Status quo | No cost, no learning curve | Disorganized, things fall through cracks |
| Spreadsheets (Excel, Sheets) | Manual tracking | Familiar, flexible, free | No AI, manual updates, clunky for tasks |
| Multiple disconnected tools | Indirect solution | Specialized features per tool | Context switching, no unified view, expensive |
| _TODO: Add direct competitors_ | Direct competitor | | |

### Exercise 2: Feature-to-Value Mapping

For each key feature, articulate the value it provides:

| Feature | Capability | Value/Benefit | Who Cares Most |
|---------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| AI Chat | | | |
| Task Management | | | |
| Workspaces | | | |
| | | | |

### Exercise 3: Customer Interview Questions

When talking to potential users, ask:
1. What were you using before you considered Citadel?
2. What problem were you trying to solve?
3. What made you switch/consider switching?
4. What would you do if Citadel went away tomorrow?
5. How would you describe Citadel to a colleague?
6. What's the one thing you couldn't live without?

### Exercise 4: "Why" Questions ✓

Answer the three critical questions:

**Why Change?** (from current solution)
> Your current approach either drowns you in process (Jira) or leaves you disorganized (spreadsheets). You're spending too much time managing work instead of doing it.

**Why Citadel?** (vs alternatives)
> AI-native from the ground up. Works inside your existing AI tools (MCP). Right-sized for small teams - no bloat, no complexity.

**Why Now?** (urgency/relevance)
> AI coding assistants have changed how developers work. Your project management should keep up.

### Key Insights from Research

**On Competitive Alternatives:**
> "How people usually mess up is the first step—competitive alternatives. The competitive alternatives to what we do are often things that don't look like direct competitors. The competitor is often something like 'do nothing' or 'hire an intern to do it.'"
> — April Dunford

**On Positioning as Context:**
> "Positioning defines how your product is a leader at delivering something that a well-defined set of customers cares a lot about."
> — April Dunford

**On the Three Questions:**
> Strong SaaS positioning answers: Why change? Why you? Why now?
> — Kalungi Framework
